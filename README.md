### About UOD MAP

---

UOD MAP (University of Dunaujvaros MAP) is a project designed to solve a long-term problem we as students have been experiencing over time, which has to do with the challenge in locating various university buildings across UOD campus. The project develops a web application that allows all new, exchange, visiting and existing students of our University with the ability to navigate university buildings with ease and comfort.

### TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

---

#### Project planning and management
- Microsoft Project 2019

#### Implementation
- Programming languages: **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**

Technologies, Libraries, and frameworks
- **NodeJS** – used for running scripts on the server to render content before it is delivered to a web browser. UODMAP uses this to open a html file on the server and return the content to the client. It uses JavaScript on both the server and client side.
- **Express.js** – Express.js (or simply Express) is a backend web application framework that runs within the NodeJS environment. It creates and starts the web server and listens to for any request from clients and respond back with requested pages accordingly. It uses HTTP protocols(get, post) to handle request and responses.
- **Nunjucks** – A templating engine for JavaScript.

IDE: Visual studio code  
Database/Data storage: **SQL database**  
Version Control: **Git**
